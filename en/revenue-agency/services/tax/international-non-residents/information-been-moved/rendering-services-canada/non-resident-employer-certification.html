<h2 id="i1">Employer withholding obligations</h2>
<p>Income that a <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> earns in Canada from an office or employment is generally taxable in Canada. However, a <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> who is a resident of a country that has a tax treaty with Canada is likely to be exempt from Canadian taxation on the salary, wages, and other remuneration (employment income) he or she earns in Canada from a <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> employer if certain conditions are met. For example, a United States resident employee will generally be exempt from Canadian taxation if the employee is present in Canada for no more than 183 days in any 12-month period starting or ending in the relevant calendar year and his or her employer has no permanent establishment in Canada.</p>
<p><span class="nowrap">Non-resident</span> employees providing employment services in Canada are subject to the same withholding, remitting, and reporting obligations as Canadian resident employees. Therefore, any employer, including a <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> employer, is required to withhold amounts on account of the income tax liability of an employee in Canada even if the employee is likely to be exempt from tax in Canada because of a tax treaty. For the employer to be relieved of their obligation to withhold, the employee would have to apply for and get an income tax waiver from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).</p>
<p>However, there is an exception to the employer's withholding obligation for certain <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> employers paying employment income to <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> employees for performing the duties of an office or employment in Canada after 2015. These <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> employers, who apply for <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> employer certification, will not have to withhold and remit tax on the payments they make to <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> employees who are working in Canada for a limited time and are exempt from tax in Canada under a tax treaty.</p>
<h2 id="i2">Qualifying for non-resident certification</h2>
<h3>What is a qualifying non-resident employer?</h3>
<h4>In the case of an employer that is not a partnership:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        A qualifying <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> employer at any time means an employer that is at the time of the payment
        <ul>
            <li>
                certified by the Minister of National Revenue under subsection 153(7) of the <em>Income Tax Act</em> and is either
                <ul>
                    <li>resident in a country that Canada has a tax treaty with, or</li>
                    <li>would be considered resident in a country that Canada has a tax treaty with, if that country treated the employer as a corporation for tax purposes (e.g., a limited liability company formed in the U.S. that has not elected to be treated as a corporation for U.S. tax purposes).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>In the case of an employer that is a partnership:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>A qualifying <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> employer at any time means an employer that is at the time of the payment a partnership where at least 90% of the partnership's income or loss for the fiscal period that includes the time of the payment is allocated to members that are resident in a country that Canada has a tax treaty with. If the income of the partnership is nil for the fiscal period, the income for the period is deemed to be $1,000,000 for the purpose of determining a member's share of the partnership income.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How do you become a qualifying non-resident employer in Canada?</h3>
<p>If you want to become a qualifying <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> employer, you have to fill out <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc473.html">Form RC473, Application for Non-Resident Employer Certification</a>, and send it to the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> for approval. Applications should be received at least 30 days before a qualifying <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> employee starts providing services in Canada.&nbsp; If you meet the definition of a qualifying <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> employer and agree to meet the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>'s conditions for certification, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> will send you an approval letter. The letter will certify that you are a qualifying <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> employer and you do not have to withhold tax on the employment income you pay to <a href="#what-qual-non-res-empl">qualifying non-resident employees </a>during the period of your certification.</p>
<p>Since non-resident employer certification applies only to payments made to qualifying <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> employees, you must withhold and remit tax on the employment income you pay to non-resident employees who are not qualifying <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> employees, unless the employee applies for and gets an income tax waiver from the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>.</p>
<p>Non-resident employees who are not qualifying non-resident employees or whose employer does not become certified can still apply to the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> for an income tax waiver using <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/r102-r.html">Form R102-R, Regulation 102 Waiver Application</a>.</p>
<h3 id="what-qual-non-res-empl">What is a qualifying non-resident employee?</h3>
<p>A qualifying <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> employee, at any time in respect of a payment of employment income, is an employee that:</p>
<ul>
    <li>is resident in a country that Canada has a tax treaty with at the time of the payment;</li>
    <li>does not have to pay tax in Canada on the payment because of a tax treaty;* and</li>
    <li>works in Canada for less than 45 days in the calendar year that includes the time of the payment or is present in Canada less than 90 days in any 12-month period that includes the time of the payment.</li>
</ul>
<p>* A qualifying <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> employer must refer to the tax treaty between Canada and the employee's country of residence to see if there is a tax exemption in place and the criteria that have to be met for it to apply.</p>
<h3>What is the difference between days worked in Canada and days of presence in Canada?</h3>
<p>Days worked in Canada include only the days during which the employee is physically present in Canada and paid by his or her employer for the time spent in Canada, which generally excludes weekends, days off, and holidays. Days of presence in Canada includes any day during which the employee is present in Canada, even if the employee is only present for a portion of the day.</p>
<p>The following is an example that illustrates the use of days worked and days of presence in Canada for the purpose of determining a <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> employee’s qualifying status:</p>
<ul>
    <li>U.S. employer certified as qualifying <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> employer (QNRER) for 2016, 2017,</li>
    <li><abbr title="qualifying non-resident employer">QNRER</abbr> will be sending their employee to work in Canada from June 5, 2016 to June 18, 2016. The employee will be spending their entire time in Canada (14 days of presence) and will be paid for 10 working days during that time,</li>
    <li>The employee is a resident of the U.S. and is expected to be exempt from tax in Canada pursuant to Article XV of the Canada - U.S. Treaty.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> employee will be paid for only 10 working days in Canada for 2016 they meet the less than 45 working days in a calendar year condition so they are considered a qualifying <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> employee and the <abbr title="qualifying non-resident employer">QNRER</abbr> will not be required to withhold tax from the employee’s remuneration for the services provided in Canada during 2016.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The same employee is also being sent to work in Canada from March 4, 2017 to May 17, 2017,</li>
    <li>Employee will be spending their entire time in Canada (75 days of presence) and will be paid for 54 working days during that time,</li>
    <li>The employee has no other days of presence in Canada for 2017.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> employee will be paid for 54 working days in Canada for 2017 they will not meet the less than 45 working days in a calendar year condition. However, they may still qualify under the days of presence condition for 2017. The employee’s days of presence during the 12 month period from <span class="nowrap">May 18, 2016</span> to <span class="nowrap">May 17, 2017</span> are 89 days (14 + 75). As a result, they meet the less than 90 days in any 12 month period that includes the time of the payment condition and therefore the <abbr title="qualifying non-resident employer">QNRER</abbr> is not required to withhold tax from the employee’s remuneration for the services provided in Canada during 2017.</p>
<h3>Who can be a certified non-resident employer?</h3>
<p><span class="nowrap">Non-resident</span> employer certification removes the requirement for <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> employers to withhold and remit tax when they pay employment income to qualifying non-resident employees. This means there would be no need for qualifying <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> employees to request waivers of withholding from the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>. The <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> employer certification period will be valid for up to two calendar years and will apply to payments made after 2015.</p>
<h3>What conditions do you have to meet to become a qualifying <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> employer?</h3>
<p>You can be certified as a qualifying <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> employer if the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> is satisfied that you are resident in a country that Canada has a tax treaty with and you agree to the following <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> conditions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        You will evaluate and document how your employee meets the definition of a qualifying <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> employee at the time you pay any employment income. To achieve this, you have to do all of the following:
        <ul>
            <li>make sure your employee meets the definition of a qualifying <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> employee on an ongoing basis</li>
            <li>
                get documents to support your employee's country of residence (e.g., passport or a signed copy of <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> Form NR301, <em>Declaration of eligibility for benefits (reduced tax) under a tax treaty for a <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> person</em>. Ensure employee specifies “employment income” in Part 7 of Form NR301.
            </li>
            <li>show how your employee is expected to be exempt from tax in Canada because of a tax treaty</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>You will track and document on an ongoing basis the number of days your qualifying <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> employee is working in Canada or is present in Canada and the employment income that corresponds to these days. <span>For more information, see “What is the difference between days worked in Canada and days of presence in Canada?”</span></li>
    <li>You will get a business number. If you are expected to make remittances, you should also register for a program account number for payroll purposes. See <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/registering-your-business/register.html">How to register for a business number</a> if you do not already have one.</li>
    <li>
        You will prepare and file a T4 slip and a T4 Summary for your <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> employee who has provided employment services in Canada that are not excluded from reporting under proposed subsection 200(1.1) of the <em>Income Tax Regulations</em>. For more information, see <span>“Does a qualifying <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> employer have to file a T4 slip and T4 Summary for tax exempt payments made to a qualifying <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> employee?” and </span><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/rc4120.html">Guide RC4120, Employers' Guide – Filing the T4 Slip and Summary</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        You will complete and file Canadian income tax returns as required by the Income Tax Act for those calendar years covered by the certification period. For example, if you are a corporation carrying on business in Canada, you have to file a corporate income tax return along with schedules T2SCH91, <em>Information Concerning Claims for <span class="nowrap">Treaty-Based</span> Exemptions</em>, and T2SCH97, <em>Additional Information on <span class="nowrap">Non-Resident</span> Corporations in Canada</em>.
    </li>
    <li>You will make your books and records available in Canada for the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> to inspect when it asks so it can verify that you are meeting the conditions of your employer certification agreement and the withholding requirements of the <em>Income Tax Act</em> and the <em>Income Tax Regulations</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="i3">How and where to apply for non-resident certification</h2>
<p>If you are sending employees to work in Canada under a contract you have entered into to provide services in Canada and will also be applying for a Regulation 105 waiver, please submit the form and the waiver together, following the instructions relative to <span class="nowrap">Non-Resident</span> Employer Certifications in <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/international-non-residents/information-been-moved/rendering-services-canada/where-send-completed-waiver-non-resident-employer-certification-applications.html">Where to send completed waiver and non-resident employer certification applications</a>.</p>
<h2 id="i4">After you become a certified non-resident employer</h2>
<h3>Does <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> employer certification affect Canada Pension Plan contributions and employment insurance premiums?</h3>
<p>Although as a qualifying <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> employer you do not have to withhold income tax on the employment income you pay to qualifying <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> employees during your period of certification, you may still have to withhold Canada Pension Plan (CPP) contributions and employment insurance (EI) premiums. However, there may be exceptions to this. An exemption of <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> may be available based on a reciprocal social security agreement between Canada and your employee's home country. These agreements make sure only one plan covers an employee—the <em>Canada Pension Plan</em> or a foreign social security plan.</p>
<p>An exemption for <abbr title="employment insurance">EI</abbr> may also be available if the unemployment insurance laws of your employee's home country require premiums to be paid on the same employment income. If you do not withhold and remit these amounts as required without the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>'s authorization, you may be held liable for the whole amount plus interest and penalties. For more information, see <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/t4001.html">Guide T4001, Employers' Guide – Payroll Deductions and Remittances</a>.</p>
<h3 id="flt4">Does a qualifying non-resident employer have to file a T4 slip and T4 Summary for tax exempt payments made to a qualifying non-resident employee?</h3>
<p>Generally speaking, a qualifying <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> employer who has made tax exempt payments to a qualifying <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> employee is required to file a T4 slip and a T4 Summary for that employee who has provided services in Canada. However, if after reasonable enquiry, the qualifying <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> employer has no reason to believe that the qualifying <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> employee’s total taxable income earned in Canada (which includes any amounts exempted from income tax in Canada pursuant to an income tax treaty) in the calendar year during which the salary was paid is more than CAN $10,000, the qualifying <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> employer does not have to file a T4 slip and a T4 Summary for that employee.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
    <li>ABC Inc., a qualifying <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> employer resident in the U.S. sends Sean, a qualifying <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> employee to work in Canada in 2016 and will be paid for 20 working days,</li>
    <li>Sean, a U.S. resident, is paid the equivalent of CAN $8,900 and has no other taxable income earned in Canada in 2016,</li>
    <li>Sean is exempt from <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> and <abbr title="employment insurance">EI </abbr>in Canada.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this case, after reasonable enquiry, Sean’s employer has determined that his taxable income earned in Canada for 2016 is not more than CAN $10,000 therefore they are not required to file a T4 slip and T4 Summary for the employment income earned in Canada.</p>
<h3>When your employee is no longer a qualifying non-resident employee</h3>
<p>If after reasonable enquiry you find that your employee no longer meets the definition of a qualifying <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> employee, you should immediately write to the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>'s Vancouver Tax Services Office – International Waivers. The letter should disclose in full your employee's circumstances, including why he or she no longer qualifies. If your employee is still <span class="nowrap">treaty-exempt</span>, you should send the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> a completed <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/r102-r.html">Form R102-R, Regulation 102 Waiver Application</a>.</p>
<p>If, after reviewing the circumstances, your employee is found to be <span class="nowrap">treaty-exempt</span>, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> will grant him or her a waiver of withholding for the rest of the employment income to be paid. In addition, as long as the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> is satisfied that you took prudent measures to proactively monitor and confirm your employee's ongoing status, it may waive any required tax withholdings retroactively for that employee. You will have to prepare and file a T4 slip and a T4 Summary for your employee reporting all amounts you paid while he or she was not qualified.</p>
<p>However, if your employee is not found to be <span class="nowrap">treaty-exempt</span>, you are expected to start withholding right away on any payments of employment income and to make arrangements to provide tax withholdings on any employment income already paid to him or her. A penalty for failing to deduct or withhold for the previous payments would not apply as long as the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> is satisfied that you took prudent measures to proactively monitor and confirm your employee's ongoing status and notified the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> right away. You will have to prepare and file a T4 slip and a T4 Summary for your employee reporting all amounts you paid while he or she was not qualified.</p>
<p>If you do not notify the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> and fully disclose when your employee no longer meets the definition of a qualifying <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> employee, you may be assessed tax, interest, and penalty on all payments of employment income you made to that employee. The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> could also revoke your certification.</p>
<h2 id="i5">Consequences of non-compliance</h2>
<h3>Penalty for failing to deduct or withhold</h3>
<p>Generally any employer is liable to a penalty if, in a calendar year, they failed to deduct or withhold an amount from a payment of employment income they made to a <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> employee for employment services performed in Canada.</p>
<p>However, this penalty will not apply when as a qualifying <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> employer you made payments of employment income to a qualifying <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> employee if, after reasonable enquiry, you had no reason to believe at the time of the payment that your employee was not a qualifying non-resident employee. Although reasonable enquiry is not defined in the <em>Income Tax Act</em>, you must take prudent measures to proactively monitor and confirm that your employee is a qualifying <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> employee.</p>
<h3>Can your compliance history affect your certification?</h3>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> will not consider your compliance history with your withholding, remitting, and reporting obligations when it reviews your initial application to become certified as a qualifying <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> employer. However, becoming certified as a qualifying <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> employer does not cancel any liability you may have related to any prior withholding, remitting, and reporting obligations. If you had prior compliance deficiencies with your obligations, you may want to contact the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/voluntary-disclosures-program-overview.html">Voluntary Disclosures Program</a>.</p>
<h3>Revocation of certification</h3>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> can revoke your certification if you do not meet the conditions of your employer certification agreement or if the facts you presented when you applied for employer certification were false. If it revokes your certification, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> will send you a revocation letter. Note that you may become liable to withhold and remit tax to the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> and be subject to any related penalties and interest for the entire period you were certified for.</p>
