<p>A proposal in bankruptcy is <strong>not</strong> a bankruptcy.</p>
<p>A proposal is when the insolvent debtor <strong>offers to repay</strong>, in whole or in part, the amounts owing to his creditors.</p>
<p>The <span class="nowrap">two types</span> of proposals are:</p>
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
    <dt>
        <strong
            ><span class="nowrap">Division <abbr title="roman numeral 1">I</abbr></span></strong
        >
        <span class="nowrap">(commercial</span> <span class="nowrap">proposal)</span>
    </dt>
    <dd>
        You can file this type of proposal if you are:
        <ul>
            <li>the insolvent person</li>
            <li>a receiver, within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Insolvency Act, <span class="nowrap">subsection 243(2)</span>, but only in relation to an insolvent person</li>
            <li>a liquidator of an insolvent person's property</li>
            <li>a bankrupt</li>
            <li>a trustee of the estate of a bankrupt</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The amount of debt determines the applicability. This type of proposal is also known as the reorganization proposal.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
        <strong
            ><span class="nowrap">Division <abbr title="roman numeral 2">II</abbr></span></strong
        >
        (<span class="nowrap">consumer proposal</span>)
    </dt>
    <dd><p>This type of proposal can only be filed by an individual who is bankrupt or insolvent. The amount and type of debt that the debtor owes determines the applicability.</p></dd>
</dl>
<p>You have to send a copy of the proposal to your <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/changes-your-business/receivership-bankruptcy/regional-intake-centres-insolvency-rici.html">Insolvency Intake Centres</a>.</p>
