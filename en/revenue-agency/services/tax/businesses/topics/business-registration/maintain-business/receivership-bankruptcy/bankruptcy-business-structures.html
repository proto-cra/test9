<h2 id="sole_proprietorships">Sole proprietorship</h2>
<p>As a sole proprietor, you and your business are the same legal entity. If you wish to continue in business, you will be considered a new legal entity beginning on the day after the assignment into bankruptcy. In this case, even if the trustee hasn't "wound up" the bankruptcy, you will need a new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/definitions-letter-a-business.html#bsnss_nmbr">business number&nbsp;(BN)</a> for your new Canada Revenue Agency accounts. As a result, you may have two <abbr title="business numbers">BN</abbr> until your old <abbr title="business number">BN</abbr> is closed. For more information on the bankruptcy process, go to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/changes-your-business/receivership-bankruptcy.html">Bankruptcy / receivership</a>.</p>
<h2 id="partnership">Partnership</h2>
<p>
    When one&nbsp;individual in a partnership made up of <strong><span class="nowrap">two&nbsp;individuals</span></strong> declares bankruptcy, the partnership can <strong>no longer</strong> exist.
</p>
<p>When a partnership includes <strong>more than</strong> <span class="nowrap">two&nbsp;individuals</span> and one declares personal bankruptcy, the partnership may continue to operate, further to an agreement between parties involved. For example, a law firm of <span class="nowrap">100&nbsp;partners</span> may have <strong>one&nbsp;partner that has</strong> declared personal <strong>bankruptcy</strong> and the law firm is not liable for the partner's personal debts. The law firm may <strong>continue in business</strong> despite the partner's personal bankruptcy.</p>
<h2 id="corporations">Corporation</h2>
<p>In most cases, unless a bankrupt <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/definitions-letter-a-business.html#Crprtn">corporation</a> pays all debts owed at the time of bankruptcy, the company ceases to exist.</p>
<p>If you wish to dissolve an incorporated business or start a new one, you will have to contact the government body that governs the affairs of your corporation.</p>
<p>
    For information on how bankruptcy affects your <abbr title="goods and services tax/harmonized sales tax"><span class="nowrap">GST/HST</span></abbr> accounts, go to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses/account-close.html">Open or manage an <span class="nowrap">account&nbsp;– Close</span></a
