<h1 property="name" id="wb-cont" dir="ltr">Change of owners, partners, or directors</h1>
<p>Depending on your business, a change of owners, partners, or directors may require different actions, such as changing legal names or registering a new business number and new program accounts.</p>
<p>To avoid any delays or issues, the Canada Revenue <span class="nowrap">Agency (CRA)</span> must have <span class="nowrap">up-to-date</span> information on any changes of owners, officers, or administrators.</p>
<p>This page covers general situations.</p>
<h2>On this page</h2>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#sole_proprietorship">Sole proprietorship</a></li>
    <li><a href="#partnership">Partnership</a></li>
    <li><a href="#corporation">Corporation</a></li>
    <li><a href="#legal_entity">Legal entity other than a sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation</a></li>
    <li><a href="#other_considerations">Other considerations</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sole_proprietorship">Sole proprietorship</h2>
<p>
    A sole proprietorship is legally and directly tied to one specific individual. If you sell or stop operating your business, you <strong>must</strong> close your business <span class="nowrap">number (BN)</span> and all your <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> program accounts by calling the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> <span class="nowrap">at <strong>1-800-959-5525</strong>.</span>
</p>
<p>A new owner can't continue using the old <abbr title="business number">BN</abbr>. They will have to get a new <abbr title="business number">BN</abbr> and new program accounts for the business. For more information, go to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/taxes/business-number.html">Business number</a>.</p>
<p>If you are a sole proprietor who is a <span class="nowrap">non-resident</span> of Canada or you have a social insurance number beginning with <span class="nowrap">a 9</span> or <span class="nowrap">a 0,</span> go to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information/non-resident-gst-hst-enquiries.html">Non-resident registration and security Enquiries</a>.</p>
<h2 id="partnership">Partnership</h2>
<p>
    If the structure of your partnership changes and a partner leaves or one is added, call the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> at <span class="nowrap"><strong>1-800-959-5525</strong></span
    >.
</p>
<p>For non-resident partnership changes, go to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information/non-resident-gst-hst-enquiries.html">Non-resident registration and security Enquiries</a>.</p>
<p>A change of partners will have a different impact on your business depending on your partnership agreement. The legal name of the business may need to change depending on how it was registered:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If the business uses a provincially registered operating name, it may not need to change</li>
    <li>If it was registered using the legal names of each partner, it may need to change</li>
</ul>
<p>In some cases, if the partners change, the business is considered a new legal entity and requires a new business number as well as new <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> program accounts.</p>
<h2 id="corporation">Corporation</h2>
<p>Before you contact the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>, any structure or owner changes for a corporation must be updated and validated with the federal or provincial incorporating authorities. The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> can't control how long it takes for an incorporating authority to update their registry.</p>
<p>Once the changes to your corporation are visible on the corporate registry, send supporting documentation to the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> to update business and owner information. For more information and steps to update director and business information, go to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/changes-your-business/access-corporate-tax-information.html">Access to corporate tax information</a>.</p>
<p>
    If your business is incorporated or formed outside of Canada, go to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information/non-resident-gst-hst-enquiries.html"><span class="nowrap">Non-resident</span>&nbsp;registration and security Enquiries</a>.
</p>
<p>It is important to make sure that the incorporating authority's registry and the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> have the correct directors' names on file. In certain circumstances, there may be legal implications for outgoing and incoming directors. We recommend that you get familiar with the corporate laws in the jurisdiction in which you are incorporated.

<h2 id="legal_entity">Legal entity other than a sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation</h2>
