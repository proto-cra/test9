<p>Bankruptcy is a legal process by which you may be <strong>discharged</strong> from most of your <strong>debts</strong>. Its purpose is to permit an honest, but unfortunate debtor to obtain a discharge from most debts, subject to reasonable conditions.</p>
<p>There are <span class="nowrap">three different</span> ways to go into bankruptcy:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>voluntary assignment</strong>, where insolvent persons make an assignment of all their assets for the general benefit of all creditors</li>
    <li><strong>involuntary assignment</strong>, when a creditor files a petition in a provincial court for a receiving order against the debtor's assets, known as being petitioned into bankruptcy</li>
    <li><strong>deemed bankruptcy</strong>, when a debtor, who has started the insolvency process, has failed to meet the requirements for filing a Division I proposal in bankruptcy under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act or has failed to adhere to the provisions provided within the proposal after it has been filed and accepted by the creditors/court</li>
</ul>
<p>You or your representative (trustee/administrator) may have to send a copy of the court-issued <strong>assignment in bankruptcy</strong>, a <strong>bankruptcy notice</strong>, or a document titled <strong>First meeting of creditors</strong> to your <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/changes-your-business/receivership-bankruptcy/regional-intake-centres-insolvency-rici.html">Insolvency Intake Centres</a>.</p>
<p>
    Usually, the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/definitions-letter-a-business.html#bsnss_nmbr">business <span class="nowrap">number (BN)</span></a> of a bankrupt client will be <strong>closed</strong> after discharge.
</p>
<h2>Rights of a bankrupt</h2>
<p>The bankrupt has the right to earn a living. For this purpose, the bankrupt is allowed to engage in or continue a taxable business activity outside of the estate, after a bankruptcy.</p>
<p>
    For more information on how bankruptcy will affect your business, go to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/changes-your-business/receivership-bankruptcy/bankruptcy-business-structures.html"><span class="nowrap">Bankruptcy –</span> Business structures</a>.
</p>
<h2><a id="responsibilities-trustee"></a>Responsibilities of the trustee in bankruptcy</h2>
<p>Under the Canada Pension <span class="nowrap">Plan (CPP)</span> and the Employment Insurance Act, the trustee in bankruptcy is the agent of the bankrupt employer in the event of an employer's liquidation, assignment, or bankruptcy.</p>
<p>If a bankrupt employer has deducted <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> contributions, employment <span class="nowrap">insurance (EI)</span> premiums, or income tax from amounts employees received before the bankruptcy but has not remitted these amounts to the Canada Revenue Agency, the trustee must hold the amounts in trust. These amounts are not part of the estate in bankruptcy and should be kept separate.</p>
<p>If a trustee continues to operate the bankrupt employer's business, the trustee must get a new <abbr title="business number">BN</abbr>. The trustee has to continue to deduct and remit the necessary <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> contributions, <abbr title="employment insurance">EI</abbr> premiums, and income tax according to the bankrupt employer's remittance schedule.</p>
<p>
    The trustee should prepare and file <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/payroll/completing-filing-information-returns/t4-information-employers/t4-slip.html"><span class="nowrap">T4 information</span> returns (slips)</a> in the usual way.

            Amounts a trustee pays to employees of a bankrupt corporation to settle claims for wages that the bankrupt employer did not pay are taxed as "other income." This income does not require <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr>, <abbr title="employment insurance">EI</abbr>, and income tax withholdings. The trustee has to report these payments on a <span class="nowrap">T4A information</span> return. For details, see <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/rc4157.html"><span class="nowrap">Guide RC4157</span>, Deducting Income Tax on Pension and Other Income, and Filing the <span class="nowrap">T4A Slip</span> and Summary</a>.
