<h2 id="section1">Document verification service</h2>
<p>You can use the document verification service to verify your identity without waiting for a CRA security code, giving you full and immediate access to your CRA account.</p>
<p>Use a mobile device to take a real-time picture of yourself and an accepted government-issued photo identification document.</p>
<h3>Who can use this service</h3>

<h2 id="section2">CRA security code</h2>
<p>If you can't use the document verification service, you can choose to have a CRA security code mailed to you.</p>
<p>When you request a CRA security code, you will have to enter the postal code or ZIP code of your current mailing address. If your postal code doesn't match what we have on file, you will have to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information.html#assistance">contact us</a> to update your address.</p>
<p>If you live outside Canada and the United States, your postal code or ZIP code is not required.</p>

<p>The CRA security code comes with an expiry date. Follow the instructions before the code expires, or you will have to request a new security code to be sent to you. Alternatively, you may be able to use the document verification service.</p>
<p>Once you get your CRA security code, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/cra-login-services.html">sign in to your CRA account</a> and enter your CRA security code when prompted.</p>

<ul>
    <li>You lost your CRA security code</li>
    <li>You did not get your CRA security code</li>
