<p>When you choose to access your CRA account or other CRA sign-in services with a Sign-In Partner, you use the same sign-in information you use for your online banking.</p>
<h2 class="h3">On this page</h2>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#section1">What is a Sign-In Partner</a></li>
    <li><a href="#section2">Who can use a Sign-In Partner</a></li>

</ul>
<h2 id="section1">What is a Sign-In Partner</h2>
<p>Sign-In Partners are organizations that have partnered with <em>Interac</em>®. This allows their customers to use their online sign-in information (for example, card numbers or usernames and passwords) to use Government of Canada services. Sign-In Partners may include financial institutions, like banks and credit unions, and others.</p>
<p>This partnership happens through the <em>Interac</em> sign-in service, which is a credential broker service that acts as a bridge between the Government of Canada and participating Sign-In Partners. The <em>Interac</em> sign-in service operates independently of the financial institutions and the Government of Canada services.</p>
<p>You may use the same banking information to sign into multiple government services, or you may use different banking information for different government services.</p>
<p>Using your existing online banking information means you don’t have to remember a different user ID and password.</p>
<p>Your bank will not charge you for using your banking credential to access government online services.</p>
<h2 id="section2">Who can use a Sign-In Partner</h2>
<p>To register with this option, you must:</p>
<ul class="fa-ul">
    <li>
        <span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>Have a social insurance number (SIN)

        <details>
            <summary>If you have lost or changed your bank card, or don't know your bank password or user ID</summary>
            <p>Contact your financial institution for help.</p>
            <p class="mrgn-tp-md">If your online banking information has changed, or you forgot your sign-in information and are locked out, you can go through the CRA account <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/cra-login-services/register-cra-sign-in-services.html#cant-access-account">registration process</a> again to regain access.</p>
        </details>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="section3">Managing your online banking credentials</h2>
<p>To revoke or change your banking user ID or password or manage your banking security questions, you should contact your financial institution for assistance.</p>
<h2 id="section4">Your privacy and Sign-In Partners</h2>
<p>When you use a Sign-In Partner, your banking information and the identity of your financial institution are not shared with the government service you are trying to access. Similarly, none of your personal tax information or information about the government service being accessed is shared with your financial institution. No personally identifying information or banking details are ever shared.</p>
<p>Because the Sign-In Partner does not provide any identity information to the Government, you must identify yourself by providing some personal information the first time you use this service.</p>
<h3 id="section4a">Using a shared device</h3>
<p>When you select the Sign-In Partner option and choose your financial institution, you will be prompted to enter your banking sign-in information. Some devices allow banking information to pre-populate. Do <strong>not</strong> use your browser's autofill for your online banking information if you register on a shared device. Unless you manually enter your own information, you could link your SIN to someone else's banking information by mistake, and the other person would have access to your tax information.</p>
<h2 id="section5">Change your sign-in option</h2>
<p>You should sign in using the option you originally registered with.</p>
<p>If you registered with a Sign-In Partner and want to change your sign-in option, you can go through the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/cra-login-services/register-cra-sign-in-services.html#cant-access-account">registration process</a> to get a CRA user ID and password to access your account.</p>
<h3>Switch your Sign-In Partner</h3>
<p>You can switch to another Sign-In Partner as long as you still have access to the one you previously used.</p>
